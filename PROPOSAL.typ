Logi-Tools is a suite of logic tools inspired by Motalen#super(size: 0.8em)[#emoji.copyright] HyperSlate#emoji.tm to fascilitate
writing logical proofs and provindg theorem provers for use in applications of logic.
Logi-Tools will expose an API that allows programmatic use of most of the tools it provides.

- Haskell
- GRPC
- React

= Goals
- A first order logic theorem prover
- A visual canvas for creating natural deduction proofs
- A library where you can use previously made proofs as new laws and rules in future proofs
